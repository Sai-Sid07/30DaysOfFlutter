stl -> Creates a Flutter Stateless Widget
The build method is what is called everytime we refresh the UI

Dart:
* Dart needs semicolons

* String Interpolation in Dart:
child: Text("${name}${days}${name2}${float}") and child: Text("$name$days$name2$float")
Both are examples of String Interpolation and the difference between {} and not using {} is that
we can include complex expressions inside {} like accessing an array and calling a method and so on.
Ex: child: Text("$name$days${"${name2}Hi"}$float") or child: Text("$name$days${name2 + "Hi"}$float")

* DataTypes:
    int days = 30;
    double float = 2.0;
    String name = "Welcome to ";
    String name2 = " days of Flutter ";
    bool isMale = true;
    num number = 1; //Can take the form of int or double
    var variable = "Hello"; //Compiler Decides the datatype based on value
    const pi = 3.14; //Cannot change the value
    final f = "Hello";
    The difference between const and final is that:
    The value of const must be decided during compile time but final need not be.
    Ex: When making an API call, we don't know the value during compile time and hence final can be used in this case.
    Another example is we can use const when assigning values like 1 + 2 but cannot be used when setting the current time 
    because that is variable in nature.
    
    Definition from Docs:
    "final" means single-assignment: a final variable or field must have an initializer. 
    Once assigned a value, a final variable's value cannot be changed. final modifies variables.
    const means that the object's entire deep state can be determined entirely at compile time and that the object 
    will be frozen and completely immutable.

* Scafold Widget:
appBar -> Equivalent to header
body -> Main content
Everything in flutter is a widget
For Footer - 
bottomNavigationBar, drawer etc
In Flutter, most of the times, the name of the widget is the name of the property

One good practice is that hover over each attribute to see the type of value it wants and then pass it accordingly.

* Functions:
returnType functionName(){

}
In case we want to have optional parameters where if the parameter isn't specified, we fix a default value
returnType functionName({int param = value}){}
when calling the function: functionNmae(param: value or leave it blank);

If we want to fix a required parameter then we use the decorator @required
returnType functionName({@required bool param1, int param2 = value}){}
Method -> Inside a class
Function -> Outside a class, standalone
Passing an argument when calling a function - (parameter:value)

void main() {
  //Main Entry Point
  //runApp is the method to call your class with the main app code
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(home: HomePage());
  }
}
BuildContext context gives us the context related information about which function resides in which file
Gives context about the location of the function in the Tree(Structure of the file).
Inside materialApp, we have multiple options like Themes:
themeMode: ThemeMode.dark, //Uses the design choice mentioned inside darkTheme
      darkTheme: ThemeData(
        brightness: Brightness.dark
      ), -> To implement dark mode and its settings

Sample:
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: HomePage(),
      themeMode: ThemeMode.dark, //Uses the design choice mentioned inside darkTheme
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.amber //Primary Swatch matches all the UI elements with the specified scheme
      ),
      darkTheme: ThemeData(
        brightness: Brightness.dark,
        appBarTheme: AppBarTheme( //This is overriden if a theme is applied in nested functions
          color: Color.fromARGB(255, 255, 238, 0) //App bar
        ),
        canvasColor: Color.fromARGB(255, 0, 0, 0) //Background
      ),
    );
  }

* Routes in Flutter:
/ is the home route and in your App body, either have home: or "/" : (context) => HomePage(). Having both will cause an error
initialRoute - This specifies the base route that should be considered. If you want it different from "/"

Classes - Name and subword always start with capital letters.
Functions - Follows camelCase
