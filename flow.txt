stl -> Creates a Flutter Stateless Widget
The build method is what is called everytime we refresh the UI

Dart:
* Dart needs semicolons

* String Interpolation in Dart:
child: Text("${name}${days}${name2}${float}") and child: Text("$name$days$name2$float")
Both are examples of String Interpolation and the difference between {} and not using {} is that
we can include complex expressions inside {} like accessing an array and calling a method and so on.
Ex: child: Text("$name$days${"${name2}Hi"}$float") or child: Text("$name$days${name2 + "Hi"}$float")

* DataTypes:
    int days = 30;
    double float = 2.0;
    String name = "Welcome to ";
    String name2 = " days of Flutter ";
    bool isMale = true;
    num number = 1; //Can take the form of int or double
    var variable = "Hello"; //Compiler Decides the datatype based on value
    const pi = 3.14; //Cannot change the value
    final f = "Hello";
    The difference between const and final is that:
    The value of const must be decided during compile time but final need not be.
    Ex: When making an API call, we don't know the value during compile time and hence final can be used in this case.
    Another example is we can use const when assigning values like 1 + 2 but cannot be used when setting the current time 
    because that is variable in nature.
    
    Definition from Docs:
    "final" means single-assignment: a final variable or field must have an initializer. 
    Once assigned a value, a final variable's value cannot be changed. final modifies variables.
    const means that the object's entire deep state can be determined entirely at compile time and that the object 
    will be frozen and completely immutable.

Scafold Widget:
appBar -> Equivalent to header
body -> Main content
Everything in flutter is a widget
For Footer - 
bottomNavigationBar, drawer etc
In Flutter, most of the times, the name of the widget is the name of the property
